smash
=========

This package provies a framework for passing `pandas` data to an **existing** D3 visualization, using either the python console or the Ipython Notebook.

This is not a D3 chart package.  For that I would check out:

- [vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent)
- [bokeh](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/Bokeh)
- [d3py](https://github.com/mikedewar/d3py)

Examples
----------

One installed, you should be able to execute the examples.  The `examples.py` script will produce four webpages:

- smash_collide_.html
- smash_cars_scatter_.html
- smash_cars_parallel_.html
- smash_iris_parallel_.html

Check out the [notebook]() example.
